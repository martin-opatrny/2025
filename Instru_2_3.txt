## EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. STUDY IDENTIFICATION
- **Column**: `Idstudy`
- **Task**: Use same ID as Document 1 (or assign starting from 1 if working independently)

### 2. MODEL AUGMENTATION

**Task 5.2 - Augmented Model Check**
- **Column**: `Augmented_base_model`
- **Task**: Determine if model has augmentations
- **Process**: Look for model modifications, extensions, or additions beyond standard version
- **Output**: 1 (Yes) or 0 (No)

**Task 5.3 - Augmentation Description**
- **Column**: `Augmentation_Description`
- **Task**: Describe model augmentations
- **Condition**: Only if Task 5.2 = 1, otherwise "NA"
- **Format**: Brief description (2-5 words)

### 3. RAMSEY RULE IDENTIFICATION

**Task 5.4 - Enhanced Ramsey Rule Identification**
- **Column**: `Ramsey_Rule`
- **Task**: Identify if the model uses a **Ramsey approach** to jointly determine optimal fiscal and monetary policy
- **Core Question**: Does the model find the optimal inflation rate by treating it as one of several **distortionary taxes** used to fund the government, because **lump-sum taxes are unavailable**?
- **Look for (Positive Signals)**:
  - Phrases: "Ramsey taxation", "optimal tax system", "inflation tax", "seigniorage", "public finance approach"
  - Assumptions: An explicit "government budget constraint" must be financed by "distortionary taxes"; the model states that "lump-sum taxes" are NOT available
  - Citations to authors like Phelps, Lucas & Stokey in the context of optimal policy
  - Discussion of inflation as a revenue source for government
  - Joint optimization of fiscal and monetary instruments
- **Rule out if (Negative Signals)**:
  - The model assumes "lump-sum taxes" are available (this usually points to the "Friedman Rule")
  - The central bank minimizes an "ad-hoc" or "quadratic loss function" (e.g., stabilizing inflation around a given target and an output gap) that is not derived from a government financing problem
  - Optimal inflation is determined solely by monetary frictions without fiscal considerations
  - The paper focuses only on monetary policy without fiscal policy integration
- **Output**: 1 (Yes - Ramsey approach) or 0 (No - not Ramsey approach)

### 4. AGENT IDENTIFICATION

**Task 5.5 - Household Agents**
- **Column**: `HH_Included`
- **Task**: Identify household agents in model
- **Search terms**: "household", "consumers", "families", "representative agent"
- **Output**: 1 (Yes) or 0 (No)

**Task 5.6 - Firm/Entrepreneur Agents**
- **Column**: `Firms_Included`
- **Task**: Identify firm/entrepreneur agents
- **Search terms**: "firms", "entrepreneurs", "producers", "companies"
- **Output**: 1 (Yes) or 0 (No)

**Task 5.7 - Banking Sector**
- **Column**: `Banks_Included`
- **Task**: Identify banking sector in model
- **Search terms**: "banks", "financial intermediaries", "banking sector", "credit"
- **Critical**: Re-read carefully if uncertain
- **Output**: 1 (Yes) or 0 (No)

**Task 5.8 - Government Verification**
- **Column**: `Government_Included`
- **Task**: Identify if government plays ACTIVE ROLE in the model
- **CRITICAL VERIFICATION**: Government must be an active model component, not just mentioned
- **Evidence of ACTIVE government role**:
  - Government budget constraint equation
  - Government spending (G) in resource constraint
  - Fiscal policy rules or instruments
  - Tax rates that affect equilibrium
  - Government debt dynamics
  - Transfer payments that enter household budget
- **NOT sufficient for marking as 1**:
  - Only mentioning "government" in text
  - Discussing government in literature review
  - Government only as policy discussion
- **Search enhanced**: Look for equations with G_t, Ï„ (tax), T (transfers), B^g (gov bonds)
- **Output**: 1 (Yes - active role) or 0 (No - not in model)

- **Note**: May vary across different results in same paper

**Task 5.18 - Exogenous Inflation**
- **Column**: `Exogenous_Inflation`
- **Task**: Check if inflation is exogenous
- **Process**: Determine if inflation is set externally (exogenous) vs. determined by model (endogenous)
- **Search terms**: "exogenous inflation", "inflation target", "inflation assumption", "given inflation rate"

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **RAMSEY RULE REQUIRES FISCAL COMPONENT** - not just "optimal policy"
2. **GOVERNMENT MUST BE ACTIVE** - not just mentioned in text
3. **BINARY VALUES ARE CRITICAL** - always 0 or 1, never blank
4. **PRICE FLEXIBILITY MAY VARY** - check for each result scenario
